 cal_nuke_dropped.1.d:0 "For the first and hopefully last time in history, a nuclear bomb has been detonated in [From.From.GetName] as part of international warfare. The unprecedented destruction stands as a testament to the devastating power of this new weapon, which is feared not only for what it can do to its targets, but what implications it has for the one who deploys it and for humanity itself.\n\nThe world holds its breath waiting for what will come next. Will this force [From.From.Owner.GetName] to surrender to avoid further terror, or will it only strengthen their resolve to strike back against those who would resort to such measures?"

 cal_nuke_dropped_2.d:0 "The nation of California, was struck by a nuclear bomb today. Despite its best efforts to stay strong, California found itself shattered in the wake of the blast which decimated its infrastructure. The shock of the attack so severely affected the Californian people that the government in power fell seemingly overnight. While [CAL.GetLeader] and his supporters were able to form a new government, only time will tell whether this New California Republic will be able to endure and rebuild."
 cal_nuke_dropped_2.a:0 "It seems the U.S. is all to eager to gobble up its broken neighbor."
 cal_nuke_dropped_2.b:0 "New California shall endure!"
 california.1.t:0 "Socialist Party Splits"
 california.1.d:0 "In an attempt to gain mass appeal for Upton Sinclair's election campaign, the Socialist Party of California (SPCA) has rebranded itself as "End Poverty in California" (EPIC), causing hardline SPCA members to disavow the reforms and form a successor party. This mass exodus is a big blow to EPIC's support base, but Sinclair's rebranding is already drawing more supporters from the California Democrats than before.\n\nRumors indicate that the new SPCA's first meeting was nothing more than "a den of gambling and prostitution", with little discussion on party planning and political issues."
 california.1.a:0 "So, they made their own party, with blackjack and hookers."

 california_coup.1.d:0 "They struck suddenly and without warning.\n\nDue to recent rumors of a plot against him by Army officers, President [CAL.GetPres] had been surrounding himself and his official residence with loyal guards. However, they were no match for the coup's forces. [CAL.GetBrownshirtsVictory] [CAL.GetPres] has not been seen since, and it is unknown whether he and his staff managed to escape or were captured.\n\nIt seems that despite the coup's careful planning, the conspirators' plans on forming a new government were left uncertain. Instead of having a designated leader take hold of the country, power still remains in the hands of a military junta."
 CAL_brownshirts_victory:0 "Called upon by the rallying cry of the conspirators, "Mobilize!", hundreds of soldiers aided by just as many brownshirt paramilitaries stormed the capitol, presidential residence, and other government buildings in the middle of the night, fighting their way in and quickly overwhelming the police and federal guards."

 california_coup.2.t:0 "Civil War Erupts"
 california_coup.2.d:0 "Rogue Army forces attempted to take control of the capital and overthrow the government, but were expelled by guards loyal to President Merriam, with the help of the Sacramento police who arrived at the last minute. As the attempt failed and the rogue soldiers were being steadily pushed back, they began to disperse and retreat to both the northern and southern ends of the country.\n\nAs a last resort, the junta which orchestrated the attempt has proclaimed a rival government, plunging California into a civil war."
 california_coup.2.a:0 "We will not fail!"
 california_coup.3.t:0 "Californian Civil War Ends"
 california_coup.3.d:0 "The civil war which has devastated California has come to an end. Anti-democratic troops[CAL.GetBrownshirtsWar] made their way back to Sacramento, this time managing to overrun the heavily entrenched garrison. They stormed the capitol, presidential residence, and other government buildings and cleared the surrounding neighborhoods of opposing forces before proclaiming victory. The deposed president has not been seen since, and it is unknown whether he and his staff managed to escape or were captured.\n\nThe ruling junta has not yet chosen a leader, ostensibly because they wish to focus on rebuilding the country first."

 california_coup.4.t:0 "A new leader for California?"
 california_coup.4.d:0 "With the nation mostly restabilized, the military junta has arguably fulfilled its purpose. The only matter left is to choose a suitable leader to guide our country into the future.\n\nThe main candidate is Thomas Williams, known to members of the junta as "our Duke" and figurehead of the fascist California Identity party before the coup, renowned for his bold and charismatic leadership skills.\n\nAlternatively, the young and ambitious Nicolas Ortiz, an outspoken proponent of falangism, is another viable candidate. Already relatively popular among the Latino population, who sometimes call him "El Principal", before the coup, he likely aims to improve relations with our southern neighbors.\n\nEven so, the other option is to leave the junta in place as it is, for the forseeable future."
 california_coup.4.a:0 "Thomas Williams is the best leader for our continuing mission."
 california_coup.4.b:0 "Ask Nicolas Ortiz to form a new government."

 california.11.t:0 "Reagan elected President"
 california.11.d:0 "The 1938 elections, between Republic Party candidate and famous actor Ronald Reagan, and Democrat candidate Alvin Kirsch, turned out to be quite suspenseful as millions of Californians sat by their radios as votes were being tallied.

 california.12.d:0 "The 1938 elections, between Republic Party candidate and famous actor Ronald Reagan, and Democrat candidate Alvin Kirsch, turned out to be quite suspenseful as millions of Californians sat by their radios as votes were being tallied. In the end, Kirsch was elected president with an extremely narrow lead of just over 9000 votes. Detractors had criticized the Democrats' chances of winning after President Merriam's decision not to run again, and for a while it seemed as if they had been right."
 california.12.a:0 "Congratulations, Mr. President."
 california.13.t:0 "Steve Shorter elected President"
 california.13.d:0 "The 1942 elections turned out to be nowhere near as suspenseful as in 1938; as Ronald Reagan's refusal to run again resulted in the Republic Party having no viable candidate, the only competition was in the Democrat primary elections between incumbent President Alvin Kirsch and dark horse candidate Steve Shorter. Largely dissatisfied with the Kirsch administration, voters flocked to the previously unknown Shorter, securing his bid for the presidency."
