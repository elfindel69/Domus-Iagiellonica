 RUS_intensify_pilot_training_program_desc:0 "To be competitve, our Air Force must be able to fly and fight in all circumstances.

 RUS_expand_aviation_institutes:0 "Expand Aviation Institutes"
 RUS_expand_aviation_institutes_desc:0 "The biggest bottleneck to increasing the size of our air force is our capacity for pilot training. By expanding our pilot schools, we will lay the foundation for a bigger and more competent air force."

 RUS_the_modern_war_in_the_skies_desc:0 "Aerial Warfare has come a long way since the days of biplanes duelling over the trenches.

 RUS_reinforce_northern_naval_bases_desc:0 "Despite being located north of the Arctic circle, Murmansk is ironically our only port that remains ice-free the entire year and has access to the open oceans. We should develop it further to allow better access to the rest of the world."
 RUS_reinforce_southern_naval_bases:0 "Reinforce Southern Naval Bases"
 RUS_reinforce_southern_naval_bases_desc:0 "The Black Sea might look like a secondary theater. But if we lose control over it, we will open up our entire southern territories up to enemy invasion, as happened in the Crimean War. We must not let this happen again, and should strengthen the naval bases in the region."

 RUS_reinforce_eastern_naval_bases_desc:0 "Even after the humiliation of 1905, the Japanese have not stopped making noises about encroaching on our territories. We must be ready for war against them, and that means strengthening our naval bases in the region."

 RUS_pc_of_the_ussr_navy_desc:0 "With our Navy becoming more modern and more capable, it is time to recognize it as a combat arm that is equal to the Army in importance. The first step is to allow the Navy to form an administration separate from the Army."
 RUS_surface_warfare:0 "Surface Warfare"
 RUS_surface_warfare_desc:0 "Capital ships require a significant investment of time and resources, and often end up being obsolete before they are even finished building. Smaller vessels can be built much faster and consequently can keep pace with technological developments much easier. We should focus on developing our light forces as the primary arm of naval warfare."
 RUS_submarine_warfare:0 "Submarine Warfare"
 RUS_submarine_warfare_desc:0 "Submarines offer significant advantages in naval combat. A well-designed modern submarine is practically undetectable before it fires its torpedoes, potentially crippling a capital ship many times its size and cost.

 RUS_long_range_raiders:0 "Long Range Raiders"
 RUS_long_range_raiders_desc:0 "With the distance from our naval bases to the main shipping lanes, our current submarines will find difficult to reach the rich hunting grounds. We should develop longer-ranged submarines to ensure we can attack our enemies where it hurts the most."
 RUS_advanced_maneuvers:0 "Advanced Maneuvers"
 RUS_advanced_maneuvers_desc:0 "Having large and modern ships is pointless if their crews have no idea of how to use them. We must institute regular, large-scale naval exercises to train our crews and officers in modern naval warfare."

 RUS_expand_the_morskaya_aviatsiya_desc:0 "Airplanes have already changed the nature of land warfare dramatically.

 RUS_the_means_to_wage_war_desc:0 "While the planes, guns and tanks in the army often attract the highest attention and look best on parades, the common soldier cares a lot more about the quality of his rifle and the comfortability of his boots. We have to acknowledge that these things are at least as important to waging war as any fighter plane or heavy howitzer."
 RUS_development_of_tankograd:0 "Development of Tankograd"
 RUS_development_of_tankograd_desc:0 "Our country stretches over vast distances, which make it impractical to ship sub-components from factory to factory. We should instead integrate our tank factories vertically - steel goes in on one end, finished tanks come out the other end."
 RUS_pc_of_mortar_armament:0 "Ministry of Mortar Armament"
 RUS_pc_of_mortar_armament_desc:0 "The humble mortar is quickly becoming the main form of indirect fire support for our units. We must therefore endeavour to produce as many mortars of all sizes as possible, and form a government agency whose only purpose is to do just that."

 RUS_strengthen_the_mobilization_plan_desc:0 "Our biggest military advantage has always been the vastness of our country and the amount of people living in it. But when it comes to getting soldiers to the front, these two things can work against each other. We have to continuously improve and update our mobilization plans to ensure that in the event of war, we can concentrate our forces quickly."
 RUS_military_engineering_university:0 "Military Engineering University"
 RUS_military_engineering_university_desc:0 "While many are proclaiming the end of trench warfare following the development of the tank and airplane, it is clear that military engineering still has a place on the modern battlefield.

 RUS_leningrad_polytechnical_institute_desc:0 "As our foremost engineering school, the [195.GetName] Polytechnical Institute has long provided our country with engineers and industrial designers.

 RUS_the_molotov_line:0 "The Tsar Line"
 RUS_the_molotov_line_desc:0 "The recent changes to the political geography of Europe have moved our western border quite a bit further west. Any old fortification plans are outdated.

 RUS_far_east_fortification_desc:1 "Ever since the war with Japan in 1905, we have kept a weary eye on the region. It is no secret that elements of the Japanese military look at our far-eastern holdings with unashamed greed.

 RUS_rehabilitated_military_desc:1 "The bolsheviks kept an extremely zealous watch on the military, and what use was it for them? While we must keep the figure of the political officer to ensure the eradication of communist-tinged thoughts, during the war we should let the military officers make judgements based on the military situation, not based on political considerations."
 RUS_military_reorganization:0 "Military Reorganization"
 RUS_military_reorganization_desc:1 "Our attempts to build a large mechanized army were noble, but more than we could afford. To win this war, we will have to focus on the arms that have carried Russian armies to victory for centuries: the Infantry and the Artillery. This will necessarily require us to disrupt the existing formations to a degree."
 RUS_desperate_measures:0 "Desperate Measures"

 RUS_lessons_of_war_desc:1 "Whatever plans we had before the war have largely not survived contact with the enemy. We must be open to the lessons this war is teaching us, and not stick to outdated dogma. Only then can we stop our retreat and start to go back on the offensive."
 
 RUS_organization_of_the_partisans:0 "Organization of the Partisans"
 RUS_organization_of_the_partisans_desc:0 "After being overrun, many soldiers left behind enemy lines choose to continue the fight instead of humiliating captivity.

 RUS_barrier_troops:0 "Barrier Troops"
 RUS_barrier_troops_desc:0 "Battle is often chaotic, and it is understandable that sometimes soldiers lose contact with higher headquarters.

 RUS_experts_in_camouflage:0 "Experts in Camouflage"
 RUS_experts_in_camouflage_desc:0 "To achieve and maintain the element of surprise, we must make absolutely sure that the enemy does not spot our troop positions or movements until it is too late. Every soldier must be trained in the art of camouflage."

 RUS_adjoined_battle_priests:0 "Adjoined Battle Priests"
 RUS_adjoined_battle_priests_desc:0 "With its power and influence recently increasing in the country, the time may have come to allow the Church to become involved in military matters. Taking on the role of Battle Priests within our military units, the clergy will make sure that the troops know that God is on our side, which will potentially increase morale and make the common soldier fight more fervently for their country."
 RUS_swap_to_political_advisors:0 "Military Political Advisors"
 RUS_swap_to_political_advisors_desc:0 "Our war is not merely a contest between nations about resources. it is a contest of political systems.

 RUS_they_will_know_fear:0 "They will Know Fear"
 RUS_they_will_know_fear_desc:0 "Our enemies have learned to fear the Red Army and the Soviet people. We have withstood the initial onslaught and it is time to fight back.

 RUS_ban_excessive_hero_worship:0 "Ban Excessive Hero Worship"
 RUS_ban_excessive_hero_worship_desc:0 "There has been a trend of publishing fanciful and wildly exaggerated accounts of Comrade Stalin's private life and his childhood. However well-intentioned, these accounts are counter-revolutionary and seek to establish a cult of heroism in the minds of the Soviet people, and seeks to replace a vigorous study of the theories of Comrade Stalin with mere blind idolatry."
